* ReplayGain support on videos if possible.

* Work on webui from use cases (albumplayback, etc).

* Signals to the webui exploiting the fact that XmlHttpRequest does not have a
  timeout.

* Devscripts dir

* Build testing library once and for all tests for speedups.

* Interlude functionality : save state, play a media, retrieve state. This is
  different from the Queue because it interupts the currently played media and
  restores playback after.

* Directory and subdirs mode, for people who like browsing their filesystem.

* Replace the proprietary protocol with the DBus protocol. The fact is that we
  probably do not want to make the the use of the DBus daemon mandatory, as it
  does not listen to the network by default, and configuring it to do so would
  probably be a security risk for the desktop user. Therefore, what is needed
  is either an access to libdbus low level message marshalling functions, or to
  rely on a pure python DBus implementation. Such implementation exists in Ruby:
  http://trac.luon.net/ruby-dbus/browser/trunk/lib/dbus/bus.rb

* Do not segfault when there is no xserver and video mode is activated.

* Build a new webui with GWT
