Coding style
  I red somewhere that the recommended usage is underscore-separated for
  variable and function names, camel-case for class names, and run-together
  lower-case for module names. It should perhaps be good to respect this, one

  This is done for the database, mediadb, source, client and xmlbuilders
  modules.
