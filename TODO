Coding style
  I red somewhere that the recommended usage is underscore-separated for
  variable and function names, camel-case for class names, and run-together
  lower-case for module names. It should perhaps be good to respect this, one
  day...
  This is done for the commandsXML, database, mediadb, source, 
  client and xmlbuilders modules.
