# Because Deejayd supports video, it makes sense for it to connect to an X
# server, even when it runs as a daemon with the privileges of a dedicated
# user. The following methods are available :
#
#   - "off" (default)
#       Do not try to connect deejayd to a X server.
#
#   - "standalone"
#       A dedicated X server is launched for the deejayd user.
#
#       Please note that in order to setup this mode, you :
#       - can edit /etc/deejayd.xinitrc in order to setup X clients to hold
#         the X session.
#       - must allow users not logged into a console to start the X server. This
#         is done using the following command :
#
#           # dpkg-reconfigure x11-common
#
#       Also note that in this mode, a X cookie is available for users that
#       are in the 'video' group in $DEEJAYD_XAUTHORITY (see below for path).
#       Therefore, accessing the Deejayd dedicated X server for other users
#       than the deejayd user is just a matter of adding the following lines to
#       your shell startup script (e.g. ~/.bashrc) :
#
#           XAUTHORITY=/var/lib/deejayd/Xauthority
#           export XAUTHORITY
#
#DEEJAYD_XSERVER_METHOD=off
#
# "standalone" mode specific options
#
DEEJAYD_XAUTHORITY=/var/lib/deejayd/Xauthority
DEEJAYD_DISPLAYNAME=:0
DEEJAYD_XINITRC=/etc/deejayd.xinitrc
